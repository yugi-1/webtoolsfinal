# Why Svelte?

I decided to use Svelte because I really love the UI it provides, itâ€™s really easy to not worry too much about UI and making it look really good and aesthetic, I also think the way you can easily bind to data to collect user input is going to be really helpful when handling a lot of them, compared to something like React.
